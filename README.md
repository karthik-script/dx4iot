As a passionate Freelancer and Udemy Instructor, I've had the incredible opportunity to guide over 1 lakh+ students through the fascinating world of Python programming. My expertise extends beyond Python, encompassing languages like C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

When not immersed in the world of code, I pursue another passion as a Stock Photographer. Capturing moments through my lens is not just a hobby but a creative outlet that adds a unique dimension to my professional journey.

Additionally, I dabble in trading during my free time, exploring the intricacies of financial markets. This multifaceted approach to my career reflects my commitment to continuous learning and embracing diverse interests.
